    "# Tips for programming\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Think about your problem, write it down mathematically.\n",
    " 1. Write down the algorithm.\n",
    " 1. Now start implementing it in code.\n",
    " 1. Possibly break the code down into some functions, so that you avoid repeating the same code in multiple places.\n",
    " 1. Put checks for array sizes, etc.\n",
    " 1. Be careful while dividing (denominator should not be zero), taking square roots (should be non-negative), etc.\n",
    " 1. Test the code on some inputs to see it is working correctly. Also test individual functions that they are correct.\n",
    " 1. If code crashes with some error, read the error message and fix the mistake. Cut and paste the error in a search engine to find solution.\n",
    " 1. Do not hard code values, define some variables and use them. This way, if you change the value, you only need to change it in one place.\n",
    " 1. Write comments in code to explain what you are doing.\n",
    " 1. Indent code for better readability.\n",
    " 1. Put spaces in formulae for better readability.\n",
    " ```\n",
    " f = x+y+z*sin(a)*cos(b)\n",
    " f = x + y + z * sin(a) * cos(b)   <== Better\n",
    " ```\n",
    " 1. Use brackets in formulae where needed. E.g., $f = \\frac{a}{b c}$\n",
    " $$\n",
    " \\textrm{f = a / b * c} \\qquad \\textrm{wrong, this gives} \\qquad f = \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) c\n",
    " $$\n",
    " correct code is\n",
    " $$\n",
    " \\textrm{f = a / (b * c)}\n",
    " $$\n",
    " Another example\n",
    " $$\n",
    " \\textrm{f = x + y + z * sin(a) * cos(b)} \\qquad \\textrm{gives} \\qquad f = x + y + (z \\sin(a) \\cos(b)) \n",
    " $$\n",
    " $$\n",
    " \\textrm{f = (x + y + z) * sin(a) * cos(b)} \\qquad \\textrm{gives} \\qquad f = (x + y + z) \\sin(a) \\cos(b)\n",
    " $$\n",
    " 1. Put a decimal when assigning float values.\n",
    " 1. Avoid writing long lines.\n",
    " 1. Print some values to see things are correct, and to monitor progress of code."
